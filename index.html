                        West Ham United also known as Thames Ironworks FC in 1895 was a club for the Thames Ironworks & Shipbuilding Company Limited.
                        The club was then reformed in 1900 as West Ham united aka the Hammers and joined the Football league second division in 1919.
                        The Hammers reached the FA Cup final and earned them selves a promotion to the First Division in 1923.
                        1964, 1975, 1980 saw the Hammers enjoy FA Cup victories, followed by a record breaking third place league finish in the 1985/86 season.
                        1993 saw the West Ham earn promotion to the Premier League where they have continued to play and cement themselves as regulars within the league.
                        The club has been represented by some of the worlds finest, most notably West Ham's and England's captain Bobby Moore.
                        The legend himself captained West Ham for over ten years and was Englands captain during the 1966 world cup which saw them win the world cup.
                        Bobby Moore is with out a doubt one of the best defenders to lace a pair of boots and cemented his name in history for club and country.
                        Another name West Ham fans cannot forget is Paolo Di Canio. The commentary of Martin Tyler after that famous scissor kick brings a smile to any Hammer fan.
                        Di Canio was a record goalscorer for West Ham.
